Hello, my name is Sean and prior to enrolling in Launch Academy I was a biomedical scientist. For three years I worked for a start-up that developed medical image analysis software. My role was to read MRI and CT scans, coordinate clinical studies, and demonstrate software to clinicians. I especially enjoyed working with the company's software developers and being amazed by how efficient they could handle data and analyses. This got me interested in learning more about code, so much so that I decided put my biomedical career on hold to learn these skills.
My experience in the biomedical field revealed a need for people with clinical knowledge and web development skills to build better applications for anyone involved or interested in the medical field. That is why I decided to build YANA, an online forum for people with chronic illnesses.
Once a user signs up, they may view essential information about chronic illnesses such as diabetes, COPD, heart failure, dementia, and depression, and the user may view the forums for each disease. The user may post on the forums to share stories, ask for help, or share new clinical trials and medical breakthroughs. Since I'm a big fan of gathering data, I also made surveys to capture user demographics and community opinions on important topics. I wanted to make data look exciting, so I used the D3.js library to build interactive data visualizations, which hopefully will entice user to explore their community.
Should users wish to meet in person, I also built a meetup feature to schedule events and organize support groups. My hope for this app is to provide as much support as possible to a patient in need. I look forward to continue building my skills and working on projects like YANA. Thank you all for your time and feel free to ask me any question.
