Hello, my name is Sean and prior to enrolling in Launch Academy I was a biomedical scientist. For three years I worked for a start-up that developed medical image analysis software. My role was to read MRI and CT scans, coordinate clinical studies, and demonstrate software to clinicians. My experience in the biomedical field revealed a need for people with clinical knowledge and web development skills to build better applications for clinicians, researchers, and patients. That is why I decided to build YANA, an online forum about chronic illnesses such as diabetes, COPD, heart failure, dementia, and depression. YANA's goal is to provide a safe environment for patients, their friends and family, and medical professionals to share stories, ask for help, and read about new medical advances. Patient and medical professional sign ups will involve a verification process with their hospital's health information system. Friends and family can only sign up if sponsored by a patient. Those who do not go through the sign up process may still learn about chronic illnesses and view YANA's forum posts, but they themselves will not be able to post. YANA also features surveys for patient demographics and community opinions and provides interactive data visualization for a wholistic perspective of the community. That being said, YANA will protect the identities of all its users and will only display population data. Should online community members wish to meet in person, YANA also includes a meetup feature, allowing members to schedule events and organize support groups. This app can be found on yana.herokuapp.com. Thank you all for your time and feel free to ask me any question.
